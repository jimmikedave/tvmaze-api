# tvmaze API - Single Page Application

This application uses the tvmaze API to showcase TV show data such as show description, seasons, and episodes. The application is built with React to utilize state management when retrieving show data. The user can search for a show and select one from a filtered drop down list. Once a show is selected, the summary of the show will be rendered on the screen along with a season selector. Once a season is selected, a timeline containing each episode will display proportionally. Each episode is represented by a dot on the timeline, and when it is clicked a description will appear along with an image.
